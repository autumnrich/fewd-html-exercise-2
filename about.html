      <h1>Autumn's Bio</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://github.com/autumnrich" target="_blank">Autumn</a>.
        <p>I'm a graphic designer by trade and transitioned into UI/UX over the past seven years. I currently work as a contractor for US Citizen and Immigration Services designing apps to improve workflows.</p>
        <p>I love to draw and paint and have been studing Illustration at the Baltimore Academy of Illustration.</p>
        <p>I have an identical twin sister and have a 15 year old daughter, both are my BFFs. I like museums, shopping, happy hours and spending time with family and friends. I was born and raised in Baltimore.</p>

      <h1>Why I Code</h1>
      <p>I've spent many years designing interfaces and creating good user experience for the web. I think learning to build the sites that I'm designing would help me become a better designer. I also think learning to code will give me an opportunity to explore new careers if I decide to make a change.</p>
